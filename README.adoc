The project demonstrates how to export and aggregate metrics from a scaled-out app ("generator") and aggregate them in a single place ("collector") via a redis repository backend. The metrics are accumulated in the generator app in memory, and exported every 5s to redis, prepending a prefix to the metric names. The prefixes are then stripped off and the aggregation done by a special purpose `MetricReader` in the collector.
